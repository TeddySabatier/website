            <div className='Text'>
            <p>I made a software using C/C++/C# combined with a SQL database to help a lumberjack get the data of his work and manage it. Basically, it contains all his clients and the buyers of the lumbers, then selecting a lumber site and a date, following those steps the lumberjack can enter with ease the data of the trees he chopped and the software filter and prints the resume that the lumber hand over to the buyers. I made that software in 1 month only, from home it was during the pandemic, and I was alone working on it. It was a good experience on how to manage a project by myself and from home, I learned how to communicate with clients that knows nothing about IT and to make their realizable ideas come true.  </p>

            <div className='Text'>

            <h2>Automation of interaction with OpenAI</h2>
            <div className='Text'>
            <p>With a team of 5 members including myself we did for a client of the school an evaluation of the most effective set of settings for completion of sentences. To make it effective we mad a bot to get the completions of every completion we did. That allowed us to be faster and test more efficiently to find the best set of settings.</p>

            <h2>Excel automations</h2>
            <div className='Text'>
            <p>I did 2 internships in Thal√®s where I made Excel files to manage and follow projects like EAC (Estimate At Completion). I also did automations on files already existing to make the employees using them focus on more important tasks.</p>

            <p>I made with 4 classmates a management software for git projects that allow to manage a lot of git projects with ease. It was in Java and it was a great experience because it was the first time I actively used Git to manage the projects and commits between the members of the group.</p>

                    <a> I first had a short internship of 1 month because of Covid during June 2020, I was working remotely, and I made a software in C/C++/C# using database in SQL for a forest management company. During the summer just after the month of July and August were spend in Thales in Saint-H√©and where I was automating Excel files to makes tasks faster. My next and last internship was in Thales again and for one month long from January till February 2021 where I continued and perfected the automations from the first internship.</a>

                    <a>I started working at the EMF (Electro Music Festival) in the south of France at Barcar√®s, I was multi-task there. My work was to lift and roll heavy beer barrels. I went there working a second year where I was familiar with how the bar worked and I did the cash desk but also filling up glasses as well as helping with heavy loads. It was hard and intensive work where you begin the day around 3pm and end it at 3-4am. I learned how to be effective and manage stress well. I worked one week as a carpenter just after coming back from working at the festival it was remarkably interesting.</a>
